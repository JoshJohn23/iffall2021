                <p>I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom</p>
                <p>Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom</p>
                <p>Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air</p>
                <p>Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair</p>
                <p>Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know, I talked to his daddy</p>
                <p>Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family</p>
                <p>He has ordered my steps, gave me a sword with a crest</p>
                <p>And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath</p>

                <p>They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor</p>
                <p>With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors</p>
                <p>Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven</p>
                <p>I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven</p>
                <p>I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions</p>
                <p>Like my ex-girl getting pregnant</p>
                <p>And her becoming my everything</p>
                <p>I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs</p>
                <p>I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled</p>
                <p>They want four-minute songs</p>
                <p>You need a four-hour praise dance performed every morn</p>
                <p>I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn</p>
                <p>Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter</p>
                <p>Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh</p>
