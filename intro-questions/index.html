        <h1>Intro-Questions</h1>
        <h3>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</h3>
            <p>My name is Joshua Johnson. I am a junior majoring in Communication Design.</p>
        <h3>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</h3>
            <p>I took this class because it is a requirement for my major, but I have always found coding rather interesting. I just never dove deep into it, and I am interested to learn more about how coding works and what I can use it for.</p>
        <h3>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</h3>
            <p>I have absolutely no experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
        <h3>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</h3>
            <p>I hope to learn more about coding and become at least somewhat familiar with and proficient at the terminology and application of writing codes to make different things.</p>
        <h3>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</h3>
            <p>I expect designing for screen to differ from designing for paper because I feel like designing for screen entails more moving and working parts. Designing for paper seems a bit more stationary because the paper is displayed to be taken in visually. On the other hand, screens seem more conducive for incorporating different functionality to the design along with the visual experience.</p>
        <h3>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike</a></p>
            <p>I think the Nike website exemplifies effective design because of the way it is laid out. There is a good combination of high quality images and videos that display the products they sell. The main page shows some of the more popular items and promotional pieces, and the dropdown menu lays out a more detailed catalog of their inventory. Additionally, the main shopping pages are easily readable, and it is easy to search more broadly for a product or narrow down a search with different filters. The site overall is also aesthetically pleasing, giving shoppers various pieces of content to look at and information to read. </p>
        <h3>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.beatsbydre.com/">Beats by Dre</a></p>
            <p>I feel the Beats website exemplifies effective communication because it makes the information accessible. There is general information available for every product on the site, and there is an even further detailed breakdown of the implemented technology on the pages of specific products. The information is readily available for shoppers so they can compare products and make the most informed purchase possible.</p>
        <h3>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a></p>
            <p>I feel that Youtube works well overall because it is a rather user friendly site. It is straightforward in the way it categorizes videos. All of the tabs for categories like subscriptions, explore, and personal channel tabs are all intuitive and easy to use. The suggested videos are also usually relevant in my experience, so whatever program or algorithm they use is working well. </p>
